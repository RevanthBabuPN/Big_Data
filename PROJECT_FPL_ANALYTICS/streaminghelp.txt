VERY IMPORTANT to give a end-line character for spark streaming otherwise wont work.
we decompiled the stream.pyc file and then made changes to the code and the file is present as utils.py in the same folder as stream.pyc

broadcast variable is dict: name.value[key]

transformed dstram object has no function as collect() -> use pprint()
